<p>The simpliest way to add a description to your track is to add an
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/trackDb/trackDbHub.html#html">html declaration</a>
in each of your track stanzas to define the location of the html. For instance, adding
<em><code>html https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/hubExamples/templatePage.html</code></em> would define this page as your track description page.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
The description should help users understand the content of the tracks and reviews the concepts
or analysis represented. Often a publication abstract can provide a good description.

<p>
Example text: This track represents the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/" target="_blank">Ensembl</a>
Regulatory Annotation of regional function and activity in each of 17 human cell types. The Ensembl
Regulatory Build provides a genome-wide set of regions that are likely to be involved in gene regulation.
These regions are classified into six functional types (see below).
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
This section describes track configuration controls, or any special display conventions such as the
meaning of different colors in your tracks. 

<p>
Example text: The colours used for each of the functional classification follow the agreed ENCODE
segmentation standard:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span style='border: 2px inset #000000; background-color:#FF0000;'>&nbsp;Bright Red&nbsp;</span> - Predicted promoters
<li><span style='border: 2px inset #000000; background-color:#FF6969;'>&nbsp;Light Red&nbsp;</span> - Predicted promoter flanking regions
<li><span style='border: 2px inset #000000; background-color:#FACA00;'>&nbsp;Orange&nbsp;</span> - Predicted enhancers
<li><span style='border: 2px inset #000000; background-color:#0ABEFE;'>&nbsp;Blue&nbsp;</span> - CTCF binding sites
<li><span style='border: 2px inset #000000; background-color:#D19D00;'>&nbsp;Gold&nbsp;</span> - Unannotated transcription factor binding sites
<li><span style='border: 2px inset #000000; background-color:#FFFC04;'>&nbsp;Yellow&nbsp;</span> - Unannotated open chromatin regions
</ul>
